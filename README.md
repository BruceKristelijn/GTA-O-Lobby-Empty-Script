# GTA-O-Lobby-Empty-Script
Simple script to run when you want your GTA ONLINE lobby to empty of players. It catches all threads of GTA, pauses them and resumes them after 10 seconds to perfectly empty the lobby for missions. Might extend it with a hotkey to use while in-game.

Funny enough I was lazy and used some stackoverflow code and the documentation, actually learned something though.
